# Welcome to the Recipes App project repository!

## Comments

Project developed in a group where the objective was to create a food and drink recipe app. It was a long project where we had several complications, but in the end we managed to organize ourselves and develop the project, which in my opinion, was functional and beautiful. This project is a consolidation of everything we've learned so far (hardskills, softskills), and it was very gratifying to see the result.
